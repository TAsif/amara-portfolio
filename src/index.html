        The aim of the design project was to work in groups of four and build an ultrasonic range finder utilizing the many different
        aspects taught throughout the course. The range finder should have been able to detect where an object was in proximity to the
        ultrasonic transducers. The time of flight was to be measured in centimeters and displayed on 7 – segment LED displays.
        Figure 1 shows the circuit diagram of the range finder and figure 2 illustrates the circuit made on breadboards.
      </p>
      <p class="p-4 pt-0 text-lg">
        This was a very challenging design project as theoretically the circuit should have worked, but experimentally it did not work.
        There were three main parts to the circuit, and some of the parts worked on their own but not as a whole. The error could have
        been because of the RS flip flop that was made. There may have been a disallowed state that was being inputted so the flip flop
        did not output anything. If we were to design a range finder again, we would use a D flip flop as there are no disallowed
        states and an output would be produced.
      </p>
      <p class="p-4 pt-0 text-lg">
        Overall, the project taught us about the different electronic components used in applications. We learned how to manage our time
        and collaborate as a group remotely.

        The aim for the design project was to utilize JK flip fops to design a digital circuit that would display my student number on a 
        7 – segment display. Truth tables and k-maps were made to obtain the results. Figure 3 shows the simulated circuit in Multisim.
      </p>
      <p class="p-4 pt-0 text-lg">
        The design project started at the beginning of the pandemic, so the project needed to be simulated on Multisim rather than being
        built on breadboards. I built each bit of my student number separately and then put everything together. The challenge was having
        the whole circuit working properly. It took a lot of rebuilding and troubleshooting as it was the first-time using Multisim in
        depth.
      </p>
      <p class="p-4 pt-0 text-lg">
        Overall, I was able to display my student number on the 7 – segment LED displays and I gained an understanding of digital systems.

        The aim of the design project was to prototype a gripping apparatus to act as a right hand prosthesis. A thumb and forefinger
        needed to be connected to a gear train mechanism driven by a single motor. The thumb and forefinger were to meet in a specified
        workspace and a specific gear ratio needed to be achieved. Figure 4 shows the simulated design in Autodesk Inventor and figure 5
        illustrates the 3D printed prosthetic.
      </p>
      <p class="p-4 pt-0 text-lg">
        A challenge we faced was in the preliminary designs where we had to design the gear train to match the specified gear ratio. It
        took a lot of calculations and guessing to get the right combination of gears. Another challenge faced was printing the gears as
        we had limited lab time to print and the printers would malfunction while the smaller gears were being printed. To fix this, we
        slowed down the print time and scaled the it down and the gears printing properly.
      </p>
      <p class="p-4 pt-0 text-lg">
        Overall, the design worked as we had wanted it to and all of the constraints were met. I learned how to read CAD drawings simulate
        designs.
